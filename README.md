# JiraSaver

Jira saver is a python script to save your team's Jira backlog to an excel file.

## Requirements
To run this script you will need:
- Python's jira library [https://pypi.org/project/jira/](https://pypi.org/project/jira/)
Download and install using `pip install jira` or `easy_install jira`
If it peaks your interest, documentation can be found [here](https://jira.readthedocs.io/)
- Excel file writing library
Download and install using `pip install xlsxwriter`

## Necessary information
Upon running the script, you will be met with 4 questions.
These are necessary to properly identify and grant the script access your Jira project.
- Username: This is your Atlassian account username, it will most likely just be your ISEP email.
- API token: This is the access token to all your Jira projects. The code handles it safely, you can check for yourself :).
To obtain it follow the steps [here](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/)
**COPY IT TO SOMEWHERE SAFE AND DON'T LOSE IT**
- Project key: You will find your project key by navigating to here:

- Server: the server is just your project's cloud URL trimmed, for example:
If this is your project's URL is something like: *https://lapr2-team06.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/KAN/boards/1/backlog*
The server is that URL's server address: https://lapr2-team06.atlassian.net
<br>

In the end, you should see something like:

## Execution
The script can be ran from the command line as long as the python interpreter is properly installed and referenced in your computer's environment variables
```bash
python save_jira.py
```

## Outputs
Upon a successful finish, two files should be created:
- backlog_issues.json
- backlog_issues.xlsx

The excel file will have a neet table with all the information you need to recreate your board

While the JSON file will have it all structured in object notation so you can further treat the data any way you like
